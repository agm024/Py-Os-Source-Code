# Hi!
This Project is an Oparative System called Py OS. It's called Py OS because, as you can guess, it was developed with python.

# Description :
**Py OS has 85% no errors in finished apps.** Please tell me if you find an error in an app please tell me how you found it.

**Note :** After using Firefox you'll need to refresh the tab in order to use the OS again.

**Need help?** A few things you should know before using Py OS :
- The default password is "a"
- Type any app name to open it (even if you type "PyThOn" it will open python)
- On a mac you still use "ctrl+c" (not "cmd+c") to exit python

**Apps :**
- Firefox
- Wikipedia
- Python
- Terminal
- TicTacToe *`Could contain bugs...`*
- Settings **`New!`** *`Could contain bugs...`*
- MyFiles **`New!`** *`Could contain bugs...`*

**Yet to be added :**
- Saving


> **Sugestions and bugs :** Feel free to tell any sugestions on aarushdarne1@gmail.com so I can add them to Py OS in the future. If you found a bug please tell me
